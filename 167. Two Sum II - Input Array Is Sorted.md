167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
 
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
 

Constraints:

2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

```bash


class Solution {
public:
    int binarySearch(const vector<int>& arr, int target,int i) {
    int left = i+1;
    int right = arr.size() - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // Prevents overflow

        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Target found
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // Search right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Search left half
        }
    }

    return -1; // Target not found
}
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        vector<int> result;
        int i=0,j=0;
        int findsol;
        for(i=0;i<numbers.size();i++){
            j=target-numbers[i];
            findsol=binarySearch(numbers,j,i);
            if(findsol!=-1) break;
        }
        result.push_back(i+1);
        result.push_back(findsol+1);
        return result;

    }
};

 
Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 500
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-104 <= target <= 104


```bash
class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // Sort the input array
        int closest = INT_MAX; // To store the closest difference found
        int result = 0; // To store the result

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 2; i++) { // Iterate over the array, excluding the last two elements
            int left = i + 1; // Start left pointer just after i
            int right = nums.size() - 1; // Start right pointer at the end of the array

            while (left < right) { // Use two-pointer approach
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]; // Calculate the sum of three numbers
                int diff = abs(target - sum); // Calculate the absolute difference from the target

                if (diff == 0) return sum; // If the difference is 0, return the sum as it's the closest possible

                if (diff < closest) { // If current difference is smaller than closest
                    closest = diff;
                    result = sum;
                }

                if (sum < target) {
                    left++; // Move left pointer rightwards if sum is less than target
                } else {
                    right--; // Move right pointer leftwards if sum is greater than target
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};

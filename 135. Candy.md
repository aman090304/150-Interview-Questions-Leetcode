135. Candy

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

Constraints:

n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104



```bash

class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
    // int ans=ratings.size();
    vector<int>candy(ratings.size(),1);
    for(int i=1;i<ratings.size();i++){
        if(ratings[i-1]<ratings[i] && candy[i]<=candy[i-1]) candy[i]=candy[i-1]+1;
    }
    for(int i=ratings.size()-2;i>=0;i--){
        if(ratings[i+1]<ratings[i] && candy[i+1]>=candy[i]) candy[i]=candy[i+1]+1;
    }
    return std::accumulate(candy.begin(), candy.end(), 0);;   
    }
};

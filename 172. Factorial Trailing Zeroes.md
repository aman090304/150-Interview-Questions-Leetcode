 
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
Example 3:

Input: n = 0
Output: 0

Explanation
Loop through powers of 5: Start with 5, then 25, 125, and so on. For each power of 5, add the integer division n / i to count.
Avoid overflow: By using long long int for i, we ensure that the multiplication i *= 5 does not overflow.


```bash

class Solution {
public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        // Count the number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to n
        for (long long int i = 5; n / i > 0; i *= 5) {
            count += n / i;
        }
        return count;
    }
};

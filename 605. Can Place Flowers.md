 
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
0 <= n <= flowerbed.length


```bash
class Solution {
public:

    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        // Add 0 to the beginning and end of the array to handle edge cases
        flowerbed.insert(flowerbed.begin(), 0);
        flowerbed.push_back(0);

        for (int i = 1; i < flowerbed.size() - 1; i++) {
            // Check if both neighbors and the current position are 0 (empty)
            if (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 && flowerbed[i] == 0 && flowerbed[i + 1] == 0) {
                // Place a flower at index i
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                // Reduce n since we placed a flower
                n--;
            }

            // If all required flowers are placed, return true
            if (n <= 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        // If we couldn't place all required flowers, return false
        return n <= 0;
    }
};

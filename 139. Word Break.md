Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
 

Constraints:


Approach:
Dynamic Programming Approach
The idea is to use a boolean array dp where dp[i] is true if the substring s[0..i-1] can be segmented into words from the wordDict.
Initialization:

We create an unordered_set from wordDict for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
We create a dp vector of size s.length() + 1 initialized to false, with dp[0] set to true because an empty string can always be segmented.
DP Array Update:

We iterate over the length of the string s from 1 to s.length().
For each i, we check every possible substring s[j, i-j] (where 0 <= j < i).
If the substring s[j, i-j] is in the wordSet and dp[j] is true (meaning the substring s[0, j-j] can be segmented), then we set dp[i] to true and break out of the inner loop.
Result:

Finally, we return dp[s.length()], which tells us if the entire string s can be segmented into words from wordDict.
Dry Run
Let's dry run with the example:

Input:
s = "leetcode"
wordDict = {"leet", "code"}
Step-by-step Execution:
Initialization:

wordSet = {"leet", "code"}
dp = [true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false] (size is 9)
Iteration:

i = 1: No substring in wordSet, dp remains unchanged.
i = 2: No substring in wordSet, dp remains unchanged.
i = 3: No substring in wordSet, dp remains unchanged.
i = 4: Substring "leet" found in wordSet, set dp[4] to true.
i = 5: No substring in wordSet, dp remains unchanged.
i = 6: No substring in wordSet, dp remains unchanged.
i = 7: No substring in wordSet, dp remains unchanged.
i = 8: Substring "code" found in wordSet (and dp[4] is true), set dp[8] to true.
Final dp Array:

dp = [true, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, true]
Result:

Return dp[8] which is true.
```bash

class Solution {
public:
    bool wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        int n = s.length();

        // Create a set of words from the vector so that the lookup cost in the
        // set becomes O(1)
        unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordDict.begin(), wordDict.end());

        // Initialize the lookup table
        vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);

        // Set the first element to true as it represents the empty string
        dp[0] = true;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                // Checking if the substring from j to i is present in the
                // wordSet and dp[j] is true
                if (dp[j] && wordSet.count(s.substr(j, i - j))) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    // If a substring is found, no need to check further smaller
                    // substrings
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        // Return the last element of dp array
        return dp[n];
    }
};

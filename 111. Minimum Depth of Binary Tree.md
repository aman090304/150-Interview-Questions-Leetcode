Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000


SOlUTION: 
int speed = []() {
        ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);
        return 0;
    }();

This code snippet is a clever trick often used in competitive programming or in situations where you need to optimize the performance of input and output operations in C++. Let's break it down:

Explanation
Lambda Function:

[]() { ... } is a lambda function in C++.
[] denotes that this is a lambda function.
() indicates that the lambda takes no parameters.
{ ... } contains the body of the lambda function.
I/O Optimization:

ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
This line unties the C++ standard streams (like cin, cout) from their C counterparts (scanf, printf). By default, C++ I/O operations (cin, cout) are synchronized with C I/O operations for compatibility, but this synchronization can slow down the execution. Disabling it makes the C++ I/O faster.
cin.tie(NULL);
This line unties cin from cout. By default, cin is tied to cout, meaning cin will flush cout before accepting input, which ensures the output appears before any input prompt. Untying them improves performance because you avoid unnecessary flushing.
cout.tie(NULL);
Similarly, this line unties cout from any other output stream, which is generally not necessary but included for completeness.
Immediate Execution:

return 0;
The lambda function returns 0.
}();
This immediately invokes the lambda function after its definition, which means the code inside the lambda is executed right away when the program starts.
Initialization of speed:

int speed = ...;
The result of the lambda function (which is 0) is assigned to the speed variable.
speed doesn't really matter; the key idea is that the lambda function runs immediately when the program starts, making the I/O optimization effective from the very beginning.
Purpose
The primary purpose of this snippet is to optimize input and output operations, which can be critical in competitive programming, where speed is crucial due to large input and output sizes.

Usage
You would typically see this code at the beginning of a C++ program when you need to handle large volumes of input/output data efficiently. After this snippet, you can use cin and cout normally, but they will be faster than usual.


```bash
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left),
 * right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int speed = []() {
        ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        cout.tie(NULL);
        return 0;
    }();
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return 0;
        int l = minDepth(root->left);
        int r = minDepth(root->right);
        if (l && r)
            return 1 + min(l, r);
        else if (!l && r)
            return 1 + r;
        else
            return 1 + l;
    }
};

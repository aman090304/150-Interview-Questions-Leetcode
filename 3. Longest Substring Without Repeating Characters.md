 
Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring
 without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


```bash

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int maxx=0,left=0,right=0;
        unordered_map<char,int> hashMap;
        for(right=0;right<s.length();right++){
            if(hashMap.count(s[right])==0 || hashMap[s[right]]<left){
                hashMap[s[right]]=right;
                maxx=max(maxx,right-left+1);

            }
            else{
                left=hashMap[s[right]]+1;
                hashMap[s[right]]=right;
            }
        }
        return maxx;
    }
};

```bash
